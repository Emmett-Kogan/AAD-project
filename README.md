# AAD-project
All I know is that for now I should implement Bellman-Ford-Moore

## Contributor(s)
1. Emmett Kogan

## Build Instructions
1. Use the makefile

## Notes
There are currently some issues with the assignment doc where the example they gave is being updated soon and the bounds of station coordinates should be adjusted as they should be [0, M) for rows and [0, N) for columns, not inclusive like the document currently states.
